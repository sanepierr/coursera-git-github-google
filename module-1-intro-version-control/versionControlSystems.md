### Review: Version Control Systems (VCS)

A Version Control System (VCS) keeps track of changes made to files over time. Instead of just saving the latest version like a normal file server, a VCS stores the full history of changes. This means you can see what changed, when it changed, who made the change, and why.

Changes are saved as **commits**, and each commit includes a message explaining the reason behind the update. These messages act like notes to your future self and make it easier to understand past decisions.

Even if you work alone, a VCS is still extremely useful. It works like a time machine for your project. If something breaks after a change, you can quickly roll back to a working version instead of trying to fix things under pressure.

Version control is especially helpful for code and configuration files because changes can be clearly compared and merged. It also makes collaboration easier when multiple people are working on the same project.

Overall, a VCS is not just a backup tool. It improves reliability, organization, and confidence when managing changes. In this course, Git will be used to demonstrate how version control works in practice.
