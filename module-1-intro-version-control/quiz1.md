| 1. Your colleague sent you a patch called `fix_names.patch`, which fixes a config file called…                                | `patch fix_names.conf < fix_names.patch`                                     |
| 2. You're helping a friend with a bug in `fix_permissions.py`. After modifying it, what command do you run to send the patch? | `diff fix_permissions.py fix_permissions_modified.py > fix_permissions.diff` |
| 3. The _____ command highlights the words that changed in a file instead of working line by line.                             | `wdiff`                                                                      |
| 4. How can we choose the return value our script returns when it finishes?                                                    | Using the exit command from the sys module                                   |
| 5. In addition to the original files, what else do we need before we can use the patch command?                               | Diff file                                                                    |
