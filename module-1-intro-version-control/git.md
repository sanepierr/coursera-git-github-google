# Introduction to Git

Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the developer of the Linux kernel. Linus designed Git to manage the Linux kernel’s development, which involved many programmers distributed across the globe. Git solved limitations that other VCS tools at the time couldn’t handle.

Today, Git is one of the most popular VCS tools, used in millions of projects. Unlike centralized systems, Git is **distributed**. Every contributor has a full copy of the repository locally. This allows fast operations and independent work. You can also set up a repository on a server as a hub for collaboration, but Git doesn’t require it.

Git can work as a standalone tool, as a server, or as a client. Clients communicate with servers using HTTP, SSH, or Git’s own protocol. Git works for projects of any size—from a single developer to thousands of contributors. It tracks code, configuration files, documentation, and more. Public hosting platforms like GitHub or GitLab make sharing easier.

The official Git website, [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com), highlights Git as a **Source Control Management (SCM)** tool—similar to VCS but slightly broader. Other VCS tools exist, such as Subversion or Mercurial, but Git was chosen in this course for its popularity, cross-platform support, and rich features.
